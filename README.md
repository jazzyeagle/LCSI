Linux Community Software Installer

Please review the LCSI Spec Document (.odt format) for more details on the whats, the whys and the hows.  Please review the Planned Phases.txt file for current status on the program (you can view my progress in the current Phase branch).

Note:  To build this program you currently need to have the code work:

Arch: qt5, qt-quick1, qt-quickcontrols (if any required packages are missing from this list, please let me know)
----

Any wishing to test for other repos, please feel free to share the identified required packages from your distro, and I will gladly expand this list.  I will eventually be testing this on other distros and will make the updates for those as needed as well.
