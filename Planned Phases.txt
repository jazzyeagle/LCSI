Programming Phase Plan

Phase 1:  Prototype (complete)
- Get the UI Running (complete)
- Create Mockup DB (complete)
- Link DB to UI (complete)

Phase 2: Prepare For Initial Pre-Alpha Release (DB will not be online)
- Update SQL Tables for full data (complete)
- Create new Dialogs for data entry (in progress)
- Link new Dialogs to DB
- Create menus/toolbars to link Dialogs to Main Window

Phase 3: Client-Server Pre-Alpha
- Give the ability to create a repository database (without the installed Table) (directly to remote server? not sure if that wold work)
- Give the ability to access a remote database (read-only to end-user, read & write to maintainer)
- Sync local database with remote database


Phase 4: Installation:  Alpha
- Create ability to scan for packages (& their versions) on local machine
- Create installation code (by the time I reach this point, I hope to have made a decision on installation method.  Current possibilities on table:  Source Code (run make, make install), Link to Distro's CLI Package Manager, Build Scripts (Most likely, I would implement Arch or Gentoo's build scripting to accelerate development))
- This should complete the mandatory requirements for the code.  Commence alpha testing.

Phase 5: Beta
- Fix all major bugs identified in alpha testing
- Implement additional approved features recommended by testers (general consensus of testers should be required to implement any recommended features)

Phase 6:  Stable Release
- Fix as many bugs as possible identified in alpha & beta testing
