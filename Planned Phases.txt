Programming Phase Plan

Phase 1:  Prototype (complete)
- Get the UI Running (complete)
- Create Mockup JSON file (complete)
- Link JSON to UI (complete)

Phase 2: Prepare For Initial Pre-Alpha Release (DB will not be online)
- Update JSON file for full data (complete)
- Create Sorting/Filtering code and link to UI (complete)
- Create plugin for data entry (updates TableView, toolbar, and context menus to allow editing) (in 
process)

Phase 3: Installation:  Pre-Alpha
(Note:  This code will be plugin based)
- Create ability to scan for packages (& their versions) on local machine
- Create installation code (Link to Distro's CLI Package Manager)

Phase 4: Client-Server (Once completed, consider software as Alpha)
- Give the ability to create a repository database (without the installed Table) (directly to remote server? not sure if that would work)
- Give the ability to access a remote database (read-only to end-user, read & write to maintainer)
- Sync local database with remote database
- Give the end-user the ability to obtain from multiple repos at a time with the option to determine on package conflict which repo's package will prevail (latest version, last update, repo order, others?)


Phase 5: Beta
- Fix all major bugs identified in alpha testing
- Implement additional approved features recommended by testers (general consensus of testers should be required to implement any recommended features)

Phase 6:  Stable Release
- Fix as many bugs as possible identified in alpha & beta testing
